# Innovation-In-Fisheries-Enforcement
In this project, I will collaborate with Global Fishing Watch to identify fishing activities in oceans using satellite-based Automatic Identification System (AIS) data collected from vessels worldwide. The AIS dataset includes information such as latitude, longitude, speed, and course of each vessel recorded over time.
